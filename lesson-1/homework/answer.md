Power BI Service – a cloud-based platform for sharing, publishing, and collaborating.

Power BI Mobile – app for viewing dashboards on mobile devices.

Feature	Power BI	Tableau
Price	More affordable (especially with Office 365)	More expensive
Ease of use	Easier for Excel users	Steeper learning curve
Visuals	Great, but slightly less customizable	Highly customizable and visually rich
Integration	Strong with Microsoft tools	Better for varied data environments

Row-Level Security (RLS)

Azure Active Directory integration
